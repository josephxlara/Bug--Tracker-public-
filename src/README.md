Hi! Welcome to Bug--Tracker's code repository. Here you will find the basics of a react project along with an array of components used to make this project come to life. Bug--Tracker is a full-stack application which utilizes Firebase's Real-Time Database on the backend and React.js on the frontend. What does this application do you ask? Well, for starters it helps coders and their respective teams manage their project's bugs, or issues. In the application, you will be able to create projects, add and assign members, and create and delete bugs. For inquiries, please contact Joseph Lara at josephlara905@gmail.com!
